This is an optimised city building suitable for game city levels.
The building is about 5300 triangles and only 4 draw calls (props not
included).
There are 7 different props for the building in a different mesh file
to allow customization. The building mesh is divided in 4 different parts:

- Building2. The main building

- Building2_details. This is a complementary mesh (using the same main 
building texture) that add details mostly to the lower part of the building. 
To be used when the player gets close to the building 

- Building2_roof. You may want to delete this part and it's texture if 
the building is never going to be seen from above. 

- Building2_trans. All the meshes that use the transparent material.
